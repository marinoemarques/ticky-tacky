Charles' teaching app. Covers:
- The newest JavaScript syntax;
- How this syntax is compiled into older JS syntax to permit it to work properly in older user agents (i.e., browsers);
- Creating reusable components with React, JSX, and the virtual DOM;
- New ideas for incorporating CSS styles into our application, e.g., styled-components and styled-map;
- How to manage state in a React application, both internally to components with React Hooks and through centralised state management with Redux and redux-observable;
- How to use a router such as react-router or connected-react-router to manage routing;
- Some very basic information on how to build and bundle your applications;
